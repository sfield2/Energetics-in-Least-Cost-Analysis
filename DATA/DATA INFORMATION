Digital Elevation Models (DEM):
Three of the four DEM models used in the research by Field et al. 2021 are included in the compressed 
file entitled "DEM". The DEM data include a single file referenced in the ANALYSIS R-script 
entitled "DEM_corridor1" and two additional DEM's entitled "DEM_corridor2" and "DEM_corridor3" that can be 
exchanged to complete much of the analysis by Fied et al. 2021. The final DEM, referenced in the ANALYSIS R-script
as "DEM_corridor3_conduit" is not publicly available, given it includes sensitive information. 

Locaiton data:
Random site locations used in the reserach by Field et al. 2021 are included in the compressed file 
entitled "origin locations". The site data include a single shapefile that contains ten random site locations, which 
are referenced in the ANALYSIS R-script as "origin locations". Additional site information, including the data
referenced in the ANALYSIS R-script as "sites" are not publicly available, given they include sensitive information.
